# SystemHealthMetrics
This model provides proactive monitoring of system health, enabling timely detection of anomalies and abnormal behavior, and facilitating effective incident response to ensure system stability and reliability.
The model collects real-time system metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network traffic, using the ’psutil’ library. Anomaly detection techniques, such as the ’Isolation Forest’ algorithm, are applied to identify anomalies that deviate from the normal patterns.
